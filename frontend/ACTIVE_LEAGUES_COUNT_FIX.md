# Active Leagues Count Fix

## 🐛 **Issue Identified**
The "Active Leagues" count card in the dashboard was showing **4** leagues when the user only had **3** active leagues. The system was incorrectly counting completed/ended leagues (like the GW6 Free2Play league that moved to "Finished Games") in the active count.

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Problem Location**
- **File**: `figma_phantacci_frontend/src/App-final.tsx`
- **Lines**: 566-569 (Active Leagues count calculation)
- **Issue**: Counting unique leagues from `leagues` array instead of `activeEntries` array

### **Code Before Fix**
```javascript
// Count unique leagues instead of total entries
const uniqueLeagues = new Set(leagues.map(entry => entry.leagueId));
return uniqueLeagues.size;
```

### **The Problem**
- `leagues` array contains **ALL** leagues the user has joined (active + completed)
- `activeEntries` array contains **ONLY** active leagues (filtered by leagueState)
- The count was using the wrong array, including completed leagues

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **Code After Fix**
```javascript
// Count unique ACTIVE leagues only (exclude completed/ended leagues)
const uniqueActiveLeagues = new Set(activeEntries.map(entry => entry.leagueId));
return uniqueActiveLeagues.size;
```

### **What Changed**
- **Before**: `leagues.map(entry => entry.leagueId)` - included all leagues
- **After**: `activeEntries.map(entry => entry.leagueId)` - only active leagues

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### **League State Filtering**
The `activeEntries` array is properly filtered to include only leagues with these states:
```javascript
const activeEntries = leagues.filter(entry => 
  entry.league?.leagueState === 'OPEN_FOR_ENTRY' || 
  entry.league?.leagueState === 'IN_PROGRESS' || 
  entry.league?.leagueState === 'WAITING_FOR_UPDATES'
);
```

### **Completed Leagues Filtering**
The `completedEntries` array includes leagues with these states:
```javascript
const completedEntries = leagues.filter(entry => 
  entry.league?.leagueState === 'FINALIZED' || 
  entry.league?.status === 'COMPLETED' // Fallback for old data
);
```

## 🎯 **Expected Result**

### **Before Fix**
- **Active Leagues Card**: Shows "4" (incorrect - includes completed GW6)
- **My Entries Tab**: Shows 3 active leagues (correct)
- **Finished Games Tab**: Shows 1 completed league (correct)

### **After Fix**
- **Active Leagues Card**: Shows "3" (correct - only active leagues)
- **My Entries Tab**: Shows 3 active leagues (unchanged - was already correct)
- **Finished Games Tab**: Shows 1 completed league (unchanged - was already correct)

## 🔍 **Verification**

### **Tab Content Verification**
✅ **My Entries Tab**: Already correctly using `activeEntries` array
✅ **Finished Games Tab**: Already correctly using `completedEntries` array
✅ **Active Leagues Count**: Now correctly using `activeEntries` array

### **Data Flow**
1. **Backend**: Returns all user leagues with proper `leagueState` values
2. **Frontend**: Filters leagues into `activeEntries` and `completedEntries`
3. **Dashboard**: Uses appropriate array for each display component
4. **Count Card**: Now uses `activeEntries` instead of all `leagues`

## 🎉 **Impact**

### **User Experience**
- ✅ **Accurate Statistics**: Active Leagues count now reflects reality
- ✅ **Consistent Data**: All dashboard components show consistent information
- ✅ **Clear Separation**: Active vs completed leagues are properly distinguished

### **Business Logic**
- ✅ **Correct Metrics**: Dashboard statistics are now accurate
- ✅ **Proper State Management**: League lifecycle states are correctly handled
- ✅ **Data Integrity**: No more confusion between active and completed leagues

## 📋 **Files Modified**

### **Frontend Files**
- `src/App-final.tsx` - Fixed Active Leagues count calculation

### **No Backend Changes Required**
- The backend was already correctly providing league state information
- The issue was purely in the frontend display logic

## 🧪 **Testing**

### **Test Scenarios**
1. **Active Leagues Count**: Should show only active leagues (3, not 4)
2. **My Entries Tab**: Should show only active leagues (unchanged)
3. **Finished Games Tab**: Should show only completed leagues (unchanged)
4. **Data Consistency**: All components should show consistent data

### **Expected Behavior**
- When a league moves from "My Entries" to "Finished Games" (e.g., GW6 completion)
- The "Active Leagues" count should decrease by 1
- The "Finished Games" tab should show the completed league
- The "My Entries" tab should no longer show the completed league

## 🎯 **Result**

**✅ FIXED: Active Leagues count now correctly shows only active leagues!**

The dashboard will now display:
- **Active Leagues**: 3 (correct)
- **My Entries**: 3 active leagues
- **Finished Games**: 1 completed league (GW6 Free2Play)

**🎉 Mission Accomplished: Dashboard statistics are now accurate and consistent!**
