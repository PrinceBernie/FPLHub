# üéÅ FPL Hub Reward System Implementation

## üìã Overview

The FPL Hub Reward System has been successfully implemented with a comprehensive bonus wallet system and streak tracking functionality. Users can now earn GHS 30 rewards for participating in 10 consecutive gameweeks of "Gameweek Champions" leagues.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Database Schema Updates

#### New Models Added:
1. **BonusWallet** - Stores promotional credits and rewards
2. **BonusTransaction** - Tracks all bonus wallet transactions
3. **StreakTracker** - Monitors consecutive gameweek participation
4. **StreakReward** - Records earned rewards and their status

#### New Enums:
- `BonusTransactionType`: STREAK_REWARD, PROMOTIONAL_CREDIT, LEAGUE_ENTRY, REFUND, ADMIN_ADJUSTMENT
- `RewardStatus`: PENDING, PROCESSED, FAILED

### Key Features

#### üéØ Streak Reward System
- **Condition**: Participate in "Gameweek Champions" for 10 consecutive gameweeks
- **Reward**: GHS 30 bonus credited to bonus wallet
- **Reset**: Missing a gameweek resets streak to 0
- **Tracking**: Automatic participation tracking when joining leagues

#### üí∞ Bonus Wallet System
- **Separate from Main Wallet**: Promotional credits stored separately
- **Usage Rules**: 
  - Can be used to pay entry fees
  - Cannot be withdrawn directly as cash
  - System uses bonus wallet first, then main wallet
- **Transaction Types**: Streak rewards, promotional credits, league entries, refunds

#### üîÑ Payment Processing
- **Smart Payment Logic**: Automatically deducts from bonus wallet first
- **Example**: Entry fee GHS 50, Bonus balance GHS 30, Main balance GHS 40
  - Deduction: GHS 30 (bonus) + GHS 20 (main)
- **Transaction Records**: Complete audit trail for all payments

## üîß Migration & Setup

### Database Migration
```bash
# Run the reward system migration
node migrate-reward-system.js
```

This migration:
- Creates bonus wallets for all existing users
- Creates streak trackers for all existing users
- Initializes historical streak data from existing league entries
- Creates historical rewards for users who already have 10+ gameweek streaks

### Environment Configuration
No additional environment variables required. The system uses existing database and authentication configurations.

## üìä Usage Examples

### User Journey
1. **User joins "Gameweek Champions" league**
   - System automatically tracks participation
   - Streak counter increments
   - If streak reaches 10, reward is created

2. **User pays entry fee**
   - System checks bonus wallet first
   - Deducts from bonus wallet, then main wallet
   - Creates transaction records

3. **User views dashboard**
   - Sees current streak progress
   - Views bonus wallet balance
   - Tracks reward eligibility

### Admin Management
1. **Process pending rewards**
   ```bash
   POST /api/rewards/admin/process-pending
   ```

2. **Add promotional credits**
   ```bash
   POST /api/rewards/admin/add-bonus
   {
     "userId": "user-id",
     "amount": 50.0,
     "type": "PROMOTIONAL_CREDIT",
     "description": "Welcome bonus"
   }
   ```

3. **View system statistics**
   ```bash
   GET /api/rewards/admin/statistics
   ```

## üéØ Business Logic

### Streak Rules
- **Consecutive Gameweeks**: Must participate in consecutive gameweeks
- **League Type**: Only "Gameweek Champions" leagues count
- **Reset Condition**: Missing any gameweek resets streak to 0
- **Reward Amount**: Fixed GHS 30 per 10-gameweek streak

### Bonus Wallet Rules
- **Non-withdrawable**: Cannot be converted to cash directly
- **Entry Fee Usage**: Can be used for league entry fees
- **Priority**: Used before main wallet for payments
- **Admin Transfer**: Admins can transfer bonus to main wallet

### Payment Logic
```javascript
// Example payment processing
Entry fee: GHS 50
Bonus balance: GHS 30
Main balance: GHS 40

Result:
- GHS 30 deducted from bonus wallet
- GHS 20 deducted from main wallet
- Total paid: GHS 50
```
